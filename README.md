# Shoplifting Detection Algorithm

This repository contains code for a shoplifting detection algorithm developed using the DCSASS dataset. We focused on the shoplifting category from the dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateohervas/dcsass-dataset). Our algorithm utilizes machine learning techniques to detect instances of shoplifting behavior in surveillance videos. Explore our code to learn more about our approach and methodology.
